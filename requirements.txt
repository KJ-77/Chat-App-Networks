# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library modules
# The following modules are used:
# - socket: For network communication
# - threading: For handling multiple clients concurrently
# - json: For message serialization/deserialization
# - datetime: For timestamps
# - sys: For command line arguments
# - tkinter: For GUI interfaces (both client and server admin panel)
# - os: For file operations and system functions

# GUI Dependencies - tkinter comes built-in with Python
# Both gui_client.py and server_gui.py use tkinter for modern interfaces

# Additional enhancements you might consider:
# cryptography>=3.4.8  # For message encryption
# colorama>=0.4.4  # For colored terminal output
